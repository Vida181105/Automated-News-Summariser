# Automated News Summarizer

This project is a web-based application that summarizes news articles using both **extractive** and **abstractive** summarization techniques. Built using Flask and NLP tools, it allows users to input or upload article content and receive concise summaries using either TextRank or a Transformer-based T5 model.

---

## Features

- 🔍 **Extractive Summarization** using TextRank with TF-IDF scoring
- 🤖 **Abstractive Summarization** using T5 Transformer from Hugging Face
- 🌐 Web Interface: Flask-powered frontend with clean HTML/CSS/JS
- 📂 Input via file upload or direct text box

---

## Techniques Used

### 1. Extractive Summarization (Unsupervised)
- Sentence tokenization using `nltk` and `punkt`
- Sentence vectors built using TF-IDF
- Cosine similarity matrix construction
- Graph creation via `networkx`
- PageRank algorithm to score and rank sentences
- Top N sentences selected for summary

### 2. Abstractive Summarization (Pretrained)
- Preprocessing and truncation of large input text
- T5-base transformer model for text generation
- Beam search decoding for summary generation
- `transformers` library for model loading
